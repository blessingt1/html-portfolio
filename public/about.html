<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a highly motivated student currently in my third and final year for 2024 at North West University, 
   where I am pursuing a BSc in IT. With a consistent average of 75+, 
   I am keen on furthering my education by pursuing an honours degree in software engineering or data science upon completing my bachelorâ€™s degree. 
   As a dedicated and academically accomplished individual, I am eager to embark on a stimulating career with a reputable company.
   My goal is to leverage my problem-solving, programming, technical, database, and administrative skills to contribute to the company's growth. 
   I am committed to expanding my knowledge of emerging trends in the information technology and software engineering sector.
